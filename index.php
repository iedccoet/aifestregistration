        <h1>What is AI fest 2.0</h1>
        <p ALIGN = justify>AI is something that is going to revolutionise our near future. Well, it has already begun.
          AI does need all the support for increasing the rate of its growth. There are a lot of AI developers and wannabe developers around us. 
          All of them require a chance to show their potential to the whole world.</p>
          
          <p ALIGN = justify>This is the main concept of the AI Fest. It will involve the great thinkers in artificial intelligence, technology and economy, as well as all the tech enthusiasts who are thrilled with the term AI itself. </p>

          <p ALIGN = justify>AI fest builds a platform for AI enthusiasts to showcase their project in front of industrial experts . So they get the opportunity to mingle and share their ideas with the experts from Google, Microsoft and Intel software innovators and well experienced experts from different parts of Kerala in this domain. This will be a very good opportunity to develop your knowledge on AI and to exhibit your talents. AI Fest at College of Engineering Thalassery would be an exciting and inspiring program which includes a lot of stirring events, mind-blowing projects and tons of enjoyment.
          If you are someone who has done researches on automotive technologies, AI, or ML, then this is the right place and the right time for you to join us.
          Support and help are provided and are open to everyone.</p>
          
          <p ALIGN = justify>This International event will provide you a marvellous opportunity to connect, develop, overcome, benefit, flourish and conquer your dreams and your goals.</p>

          <p ALIGN = justify>AI Fest 2.0 is officially backed by Kerala Startup Mission, Full Contact and IndiaMLCC.</p>
          <br>

        <!--<p ALIGN = justify>IEDC of College of Engineering Thalassery has about 15 core members with a strong background in AI and Machine Learning. We have two funded projects- iGATE (Completed-under KSCSTE) and Computer Vision Microscope. iGATE is a railway transportation safety project based on ML capabilities. The latter one Computer Vision Microscope which won the 10th idea fest is currently under development. This project utilizes Machine Learning based analysis to analyze microscopic feed for diseases.</p>

        <p ALIGN = justify >Thank you for the support provided by Future Technologies Lab and Kerala Start-up Mission. We have obtained much valuable knowledge and contacts to enable us to develop even more innovative ideas. By being involved in these projects candidates have gained the confidence to guide more projects and our IEDC has been conducting programmes such as MLCC (Machine Learning Crash Course) backed by Google to motivate students to be involved in projects. Nowadays many final year projects are also being developed by Machine Learning. Students showed interest to develop their own AI based projects after attending many ML sessions. As a result of that, there are about 11 Machine Learning Projects- now in the design phase and the team leaders are confident enough to complete. Currently, some projects are being developed in-house by the interested candidates. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p ALIGN = justify>We are planning to showcase the following projects :-</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>1. Ball catching Robot - An articulatory arm to catch balls by judging the trajectory and other physical features of a ball before it reaches the other end. Using ML this project is able to improve throughout its functioning.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>2. Autonomous car - Neural network based car that detects the environmental features and responds accordingly to the present needs</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>3. TensorFlow.js ( JavaScript framework for machine learning using TensorFlow) - TensorFlow.js is a framework upon which many browser-based AI games and entertainment activities can be developed. Around ten members under these group are developing different types of AI games using this framework.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>4. Voice Assistant for visually impaired people based on Machine learning -. The application works by coupling with an external camera and headset. We utilize the possibilities of machine learning based object detection to detect objects from the video feeds of the camera placed on the sunglasses. We then use voice assistant technologies to interact with the user through the headset giving the user a clear picture of the environment surrounding him.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>5. Song Genre Classifier - The project aims at classifying songs (basically English) based on their genre. We plan to use machine learning for doing the same. After some research, we decided to use convolutional neural networks with the spectrogram of the songs for classification, as it is being used for speech recognition and other sound related projects.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>6. Plantain leaf disease prediction - Identify the pests and diseases in a plant using it's leaf pictures and a pre-trained neural network</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>7. Digi-AID - Digital personal assistant app which uses Augmented Reality. This AR based app enables people with disabilities to rehabilitate.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>8. AI Video player for Cast Recognition - This project aims at creating a video player for recognizing the face in a movie/video. Also trying to create a large dataset of actors and to improve the face recognition accuracy rate.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>9. Face auto unlocks system for traditional doors - This project aims at analyzing facial features to produce a sophisticated locking system.</p>

        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>10.  Reinforcement  AI Auto Dancer -  Utilizes pose estimation technique to analyze music histogram and using reinforcement learning to train dance moves.</p>

        <br>
        <p ALIGN = justify>11.       Rolleiflex.ai - A camera system which captures images and removes background by holding humans and regenerate images using GAN by placing given background images. Objects are arranged by keeping the size ratio of background images automatically.</p>-->
